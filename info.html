        It is one of the best diploma colleges in Nadia.

        Placements: A good number of students got placed irrespective of the current pandemic situation of the world. But the companies visited here were not much good, and the salary packages offered were not very high or were below average. Top recruiting companies here are L&T, Capgemini, Valeo, etc.

        Infrastructure: The infrastructure is mostly good here. There are quite a few digital classrooms, and classes were held semi-regularly here. The library does its job, but renovation is required here. The renovation is also required in the canteen. There are a good number of different separately operated workshops. The sports ground is huge. Overall, mostly everything is available here, but many things are not completely utilised.
        
        Faculty: Teachers here are helpful and mostly qualified, but certainly, more professors and teaching staff members are required. Lab works are done pretty seriously. Workshops are maintained, so students are provided with most of the things required to be industry-ready. The difficulty of semester exams is average and may be above average in certain cases. But that varies from year to year.

        Overall, I like this college.
      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Placements: About 20-25% of the students from our course got placed. As it is a government college, there is no salary package system. L&T is a top recruiting company of our course got placements. About 20-40% of the students from our course got an internship. Top roles like junior engineers, site engineers, Autocad engineers, surveyors, etc., are offered to the students.

        Infrastructure: Everything is good in the college. Especially the library is very helpful for me. Classrooms are very good and in a student-friendly condition here. Sports and game facilities are outstanding. The quality of the food served in the canteen is great.
        
        Faculty: Being a government college, every teacher is every efficient, good and helpful. Almost 98% is the pass percentage. Semester exams are very easy for me.
        
        Other: I have chosen this course because of my choice, and I like this trade. I think our college should improve the gym room in our college, and it was not in the right condition. Everything is good here. <br>

        "Best and Good between the college"
      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Placement Experience : From the 5th semester, students become eligible for campus placement. I don't remember that expected number but many companies came for campus placement. The average package of the 1.5 L salary students gets from the college campus.
Remarks : This is a very good college. Some teachers are friendly but some are not. All-day class attend necessary. Its placement is so good for all departments but for CST, it's too short. It has civil, mechanical, CST and electric branches. <br>

"Third best government polytechnic college for computer science and technology."
      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Placement Experience : Final year meaning 3rd year. You'll eligible for campusing when you're in 3rd year. I've attended pool campusing (marble box solutions), there are others like Capgemini and apart from that are not that good companies. I didn't get to see good companies coming for computer science. In my class, there were 33 students, 5-6 students got placed and others are pursuing BTech. I'll also pursue BTech now.
        Remarks : After completing 12th (Vocational), I ranked 777 in WBSCTE VOCLET (lateral entrance test). After researching about the best government polytechnic colleges, I got to know that APC Roy polytechnic is the best and then BPCIT, CCP, etc. So I made a list with that. I got selected in BPCIT. Admission fees are affordable, about 300/sem. Honestly saying BPCIT is the best government college for CIVIL maybe but not for Computer science. As a lateral student, I had spent two years in that college. There were two good teachers and the others are average. Some teachers are very helpful but some of them are not enough qualified or not interested in helping in my eyes. Placements are not very good but I saw 5-6 companies came. But those companies are not that good. But you'll get pool campusing. <br>
